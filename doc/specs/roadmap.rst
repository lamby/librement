Roadmap
=======

Version 0.1
-----------

This version should support the following points of the specification:

* :ref:`spec-payment-service`
* :ref:`spec-std-account`
* :ref:`spec-basic-profile`
* :ref:`spec-accounting`
* :ref:`spec-bookstore`
  The library application should be fairly complete at least from
  the side of the user who is buying and reading the book. Order of paper
  books will be dealt manually, the integration with lulu.com is left for
  later. However it's important to support combined sales of paperback
  and ebooks.

  We can do without any form to upload book files and deal with creation
  of new book as manual operations in the admin interface.
  
Version 0.2
-----------

This version should bring the support of the :ref:`donation service
<spec-donation>`.
