Description: Free software funding platform
 Librement is a platform to help:
  - free software developers who want to fund their free software work
  - free software projects which want to raise money
 .
 The platform provides multiple services (highly engaging donation widgets,
 bookstores, etc.) that each project/developer can setup in a few minutes.
 The platform takes care of all the administrative work (accounting...)
 and lets you concentrate on your free software work.
 .
 Raising money is a subtle mix of marketing and providing value to users
 (both individuals and companies) that's hard to achieve. The ready-to-use
 services provided by Librement build up on the experience of people who
 managed to raise significant amounts of money for free software projects.
