Librement is a platform to help:
- free software developers who want to fund their free software work
- free software projects which want to raise money

The platform provides multiple services (highly engaging donation widgets,
bookstores, etc.) that each project/developer can setup in a few minutes.
The platform takes care of all the administrative work (accounting...)
and lets you concentrate on your free software work.

Raising money is a subtle mix of marketing and providing value to users
(both individuals and companies) that's hard to achieve. The ready-to-use
services provided by Librement build up on the experience of people who
managed to raise significant amounts of money for free software projects.

The marketing associated to the various services help to build a lasting
relationship with users so that they become regular donators. If librement
ever gets successful, thanks to an interesting network effect, it will be
easier for a given project/developer to gain new donators that are already
using librement (but in the context of another project/developer).

http://librement.net is run by me (Raphaël Hertzog) under the umbrella of
my company (Freexian SARL, http://www.freexian.com). I truly believe that
such a funding platform can be successful but we need to avoid
fragmentation. As such, I highly encourage you to not setup alternative
platforms based on this code.

You're however more than welcome to submit improvements and fixes so
that the librement.net service suits your needs!
